Computer System Architecture Replacement Policy Project

For this part of your assignment, you will need to have a clear idea of what you replacement policy will
do. You will base your policy on the policy you read about and studied from the previous assignment but you will make new decisions based on your understanding on how caches work and must be ready to justify such decisions.
This coming Monday you are responsible to show some progress on the implementation of your policy. In order to do so, follow these steps:


    Create a new directory under the replacement/ directory
    Create a new .cc file where you will copy over the code found in lru/lru.cc. Make sure both name for the directory and file match
    Replace the code in the two main functions to match your idea.
    To test your code (not necessary for Monday) you need to modify the .json file and replace lru with the name of your policy as the replacement policy for the LLC

Include:


    Detail explanation on how your policy differs from the original policy you use.
    Use diagrams to explain the functionality of your policy results
    You will run 3 experiments per policy (6 total) 3 with LRU, 3 with your policy and graph the results according the the IPC metric.
    If your code is different from what you submit earlier, attach it as well.
